A report by Oxfam Ghana has revealed that Ghana is currently failing in its quest to minimize inequality, especially in the areas of health, employment, wages and education.</p><p style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: &quot;Work Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;">Reacting to the findings, Professor Bokpin said the situation may escalate due to the Free SHS Policy.</p><p style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: &quot;Work Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;">“The understanding is that before Free Senior High School, access to education, affordability were issues. But now that it has been made free, the expectation is that we are likely to get people graduating from the senior high school, entering the tertiary institution from very low-income level, or practicability with nothing; and chances that they may have difficulties meeting their financial commitments at the tertiary level. Even now, we have several encounters. But we expected that this may increase because of the effects that Free Senior High School will have.</p><p style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: &quot;Work Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;">“Positive though in terms of getting people from practically low income level through to the tertiary level. But then the challenge of meeting financial obligations at the tertiary level will then show up, because there it’s not free,” he explained. He expressed these concerns at the launch of Oxfam’s Ghana’s report on inequality indexes in Ghana.</p><p style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: &quot;Work Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;">The report was launched at the African Regent Hotel on Thursday, November 4, 2021.</p><p style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: &quot;Work Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;">Commenting on the report, Prof Bokpin also expressed his displeasure at what he describes as government’s inability to deal decisively with unemployment in the country.</p><p style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: &quot;Work Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;">In his review, the situation can be addressed if government creates a more friendly entrepreneurial ecosystem, particularly for the youth. “The biggest threat to our democracy today is unemployment, youth employment. And the reason is because we have not created that entrepreneurial ecosystem that would enable the youth with their entrepreneurial skills or so to go into sustainable business practice … We have turned the whole economy into a procurement economy. And the key actors from there illicit the margins from there, and there’s no trickle-down effect.”</p><p style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: &quot;Work Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;">He further lamented the high interest rates in the country, a situation which he says is a disincentive to entrepreneurs in the country.</p><p style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: &quot;Work Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;">Oxfam’s report on inequality in Ghana revealed widening gaps between the privileged and the marginalised in society. According to the findings, inequality is more severe in areas such as education, health, employment and compensation for workers.</p><p style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); font-family: &quot;Work Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: -0.5px;">As part of measures to address the widening inequality situation, the report urged government to consider more aggressive methods of mobilising tax revenue, especially from the rich in society. The report, which was discussed by stakeholders in the health, education, finance and agriculture sectors, as well as Persons With Disabilities (PWDs), was launched by Oxfam Ghana in partnership with SEND Ghana and the CSOs Platform on SDGs.</p><p style="margin: 20px auto;

International/ISODEC engage Parliamentary Select Committee for Local Government on GSAM ', '<p>CARE International in Ghana and Integrated Social Development Centre (ISODEC), have engaged the Parliamentary Select Committee for Local Government, Decentralization, and Rural Development on the Ghana Strengthening Accountability Mechanism (GSAM) Activity.</p><p>The GSAM is an eight-year USAID-funded project seeking to improve accountability, transparency and performance at the local government level by strengthening the Government and citizens'' oversight of capital development projects in 100 districts across 10 regions of Ghana. </p><p>The 100 districts are divided into two categories of 50 "Audit Districts" and 50 "Social Accountability Districts". </p><p>CARE International in Ghana, OXFAM in Ghana and ISODEC, which form the GSAM Consortium, are working together with the Ghana Audit Service (GAS), 25 Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and other local and national level stakeholders to implement the project from 2014 to 2022. </p><p>The aim of the meeting was to brief the Parliamentarians on key findings of the project and the lessons learnt so far such as the institutionalization of the annual performance audit at the decentralized level.</p><p>The GSAM project was designed to help bridge the information and accountability gaps, especially at the local level, by increasing information flow to citizens on District Assembly processes, particularly the planning and execution of capital development projects and creating avenues for citizen monitoring, assessment and feedback. </p><p>Mr. Bernard Anaba, a Policy Analyst at ISODEC, in his presentation, said information and social accountability improved local governance, thus transparency, accountability and performance. </p><p>He said the GSAM used both bottom-up and top-down accountability mechanisms, adding that the key interventions were CSO/Citizen Capacity Strengthening in Capital Project Monitoring, Development of Scorecards on District Assemblies'' Performance, Citizen-Local Government Interfaces, Information and Advocacy Campaigns and Performance Auditing in collaboration with GAS. </p><p>Touching on key results of the GSAM Activity, Mr. Anaba cited increased citizen oversight of capital projects, leading to reduction in incidence of corruption, improved responsiveness of Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assembles (MMDAs) in capital project delivery, improved quality of capital project implementation and improvement in social service delivery </p><p>He said increased citizen participation/oversight of capital projects leading to reduction in incidence of corruption, which was 26 per cent in 2015, increased to 38 per cent in 2020. </p><p>With sample cases, he mentioned the provision of a ceiling for a classroom block at <span style="font-weight: 600;">Kalegu</span> in <span style="font-weight: 600;">Zabzugu</span> <span style="font-weight: 600;">District in the Northern Region</span> and the replacement of sub-standard beams for a three-unit classroom block at<span style="font-weight: 600;"> Mpraem</span> in the <span style="font-weight: 600;">Wassa East District</span> of the <span style="font-weight: 600;">Western Region</span> </p><p>Mr. Anaba said in the project districts, improved responsiveness of MMDAs to citizen''s need, which was 18.7 per cent in 2015 had increased to 54 per cent in 2020, citing a three-­unit teachers'' bungalow being revised to six-unit bungalow at Asante in <span style="font-weight: 600;">Sefwi Akontombra District of the Western Region</span> and a contractor, including a disability ramp in the construction of a <span style="font-weight: 600;">classroom block at Adzorvi in the Agortime Ziope District of the Volta Region </span></p><p>On lessons learnt from the GSAM Activity, Mr. Anaba said many administrators at the decentralized level were motivated to respond to citizens'' demands, but were mostly unable to do so because of political pressure. </p><p>Concerning the major achievements of the project, he said the use of community scorecards was very instrumental in engendering local participation and citizens'' knowledge. </p><p>He said the use of community volunteers and the performance audit was an important top­-down accountability process that provided a technical appraisal of the MMDA process. </p><p>He recommended that the Select Committee on Local Government, Decentralization and Rural Development adopted the concept of Community Development Monitors alongside the sub-local structures in their community engagements and project monitoring activities. </p><p>He also urged Assemblies to use Community score-cards in community engagement on projects and service delivery engagements. </p><p>Mr. Samuel A Boateng, Deputy Chief of Party, GSAM Activity, CARE International in Ghana, said the project, which started in 2014 was expected to end in September 2022. </p><p><br></p><p>He said having implemented the project for the past eight years, they felt that there were some things that required the support of the Select Committee to push into policies, laws and other things that were within their mandate. </p><p>Mr. Emmanuel Gyamfi, Chairman, Parliamentary Select Committee on Local Government and Rural Development, commenting on the analysis report of the Auditor-General, noted that it was too general and that there was also the need for some detailed work over the content, so that one could be able to make reference to it </p><p>Mr. Edwin Nii Lantey Vanderpuye, Ranking Member, Parliamentary Select Committee on Local Government and Rural Development, said the GSAM Activity was a very good project, saying, "just that in Ghana as we all know, we don''t seem to take some of these things too seriously". </p><p>"One fundamental principle under this that I urge them to do was to link up those behind this project with those behind the District League Table so that we could effectively see how they collaborate; because I believe that transparency and accountability should also be some of the key

The forum forms part of a series of lectures under ISODEC''s general advocacy programs to generate debate on issues confronting the nation.&nbsp;</p><p>The forum discussed topics like "HIPC, conditionalities and Ghana''s Development Options"; "The Social and Economic Consequences of current Austerity Measures"; and "Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy Program: A conditionality or a development strategy?"&nbsp;</p><p>ISODEC noted that the IMF and the World Bank have been deeply involved in formulating public policies in Ghana within the past two decades, and the processes, mechanisms and impacts of this involvement in overall national economic development remain subjects of intense debate and concern.&nbsp;</p><p>The advocacy group pointed out that the introduction of Ghana/lMF/World Bank Poverty Reduction Strategy Programme&nbsp;</p><p>(PRSP) and the Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) respectively, and Ghana''s decision to access the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) package has taken the country''s economic policy engagement with external development partners to even greater limits and dimensions.&nbsp;</p><p>"Several anxieties and questions agitate the minds of many social partners who are not privileged to be part of the design, adoption and implementation of these programs but often are burdened with the greatest incidence of their impacts", noted ISODEC.&nbsp;</p><p>It said the practice of imposing conditionalities infringe on a borrowing country''s sovereignty and shrink the democratic arena or political space within which citizens can operate.

The absence of trade policy from PRSPs
', '<p>Summary
Few development issues are as hotly debated as international trade. Economic growth through 
trade has the potential to lift billions out of poverty. But rapid and insensitive liberalisation has 
often forced poor people to compete in world markets at times when they are least prepared to 
do so, undermining their livelihoods and increasing their vulnerability. Trade exerts a powerful 
force on development and poverty reduction.
Given the importance of trade, one would expect the effects of different trade policies to be 
thoroughly dissected and analysed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) – the flagship 
development framework of donors and national governments. But evidence suggests otherwise.
This briefing note draws on research commissioned by Christian Aid into the trade and poverty 
content of PRSPs.1
 This research finds that the current round of PRSPs say very little about 
trade policy. More importantly, even where PRSPs do contain a discussion on trade, trade policy 
choices are rarely underpinned by a holistic analysis of poverty in each country. PRSPs fail to 
consider the impacts of trade on different groups of poor and vulnerable people. Effects are not 
disaggregated between consumers, producers and employees, between urban and rural 
populations, or by gender. Dimensions of poverty beyond income – risk and insecurity, access to 
services, and empowerment – are almost completely ignored.
This suggests that, despite the rhetoric of PRSPs, trade policy is not determined in a 
participatory way that draws on the perspectives and aspirations of different groups of people in 
each country. In the absence of ex-ante impact studies, there is also no reason to believe that 
trade policy has been designed to maximise its contribution to poverty reduction.
Christian Aid argues that the way that trade and trade policy is currently treated in PRSPs is 
dangerous for a several reasons. Although trade-poverty linkages are complex and likely to vary 
between countries, the limited discussion of trade policy in PRSPs tends to use the simplistic 
language of wholesale and rapid liberalisation. The World Bank Sourcebook chapter on trade 
appears to provide the blueprint. Donors and governments have therefore failed to encourage a 
national debate on trade policy choices and trade-offs.
PRSPs should also, by their very nature, consider the impacts of different trade policies on 
poverty. But this has not been happening. Only one Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) 
was conducted on trade policy for the 17 countries reviewed.2
Despite this disjuncture between trade and poverty analyses, the World Bank and IMF continue 
to include ‘conditionality’ on trade policy reform in their loan agreements. Christian Aid argues 
that this practice should be discontinued for two reasons. First, trade policy reforms to which 
conditions are applied are not underpinned by a holistic understanding of poverty in each 
country. So the analytic justification for this approach is weak. Second, the use of conditions 
creates suspicion of undue influence and the misuse of lending programmes. Ultimately, it 
precludes the transfer of ‘ownership’ of the development agenda and the role of trade policy 
within it.

You will see it also in our investment laws which grants tax incentives; sweeping ones of course to capital, so you bring in your investment and you become entitled to wide range of tax incentives which are denied poor people so in the course of time, we have had growing disparities between the rich and the poor and in the process widening the inequality gap in our country.”</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Dr. Manteaw, who is also the immediate past Chairman of the Public Interest and Accountability Committee (PIAC) emphasized that the withdrawal of subsidies have worsened the plight of the poor than the middle and upper class in society.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">“Of course, I am aware there has been some social protection strategies and in the particular case of the utility sector, you find that in the name of the liberalisation, we have withdrawn subsidies; a move which in my view hurts the poor more than the rich because most people; senior office holders and managers in the private sector have ways in which they are able to pass on or to recover the extra cost burden imposed by subsidy withdrawals. A lot of them are entitled to fuel coupons or allowances which are often denied the junior staff of most enterprises so then, when you withdraw subsidies, the poor workers will have to bear the burden of the full cost of increases in transportation fares whereas those in the upper echelons in the corporate world will pass on or the cost will be recovered by their employers therefore making the effect of the tariff withdrawals less burdensome on their incomes,” he remarked.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">The Policy Analyst described the country’s system of taxation administration as not fair, a development which has the potential of widening the inequality gap between the haves and the have-nots.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">He stated, “The tax system in Ghana is not fair because we have shifted the burden of taxation onto the poor and the marginalized in society.

This caused delays</p><p>with planning and conducting interviews. However, the lockdown was short-lived. The ban on travel</p><p>outside Freetown was soon lifted after two weeks which enabled enumerators to go round the</p><p>country on data collection.</p><p>Overall, the findings have affirmed that public governance, private lives of people and the commercial</p><p>sector were all directly or indirectly impacted by the pandemic. Most of these impacts are negative –</p><p>including a drastic decline in public revenue, break in the supply chain of mining products, drop in</p><p>market value of some mineral resources, rush for the extraction of some resources such as gold and</p><p>timber due to hike in market prices, but that also brought along a serious environmental impact. There</p><p>has been loss of jobs, especially in the mining, entertainment and tourism sectors. The public health</p><p>sector has been badly exposed to public mistrust, thus giving rise to many Sierra Leoneans not</p><p>preferring to go to public health facilities when sick.</p><p>Authorities in some mining communities reported acute increase in unemployment for the past year</p><p>- 2020. There are also cases of delayed payment of subnational benefits such as surface rents and</p><p>community development funds. This is exactly within the COVID-19 period, and representatives of</p><p>mining companies interviewed blamed it on the difficult economic situation created by the COVID-19</p><p>pandemic. They however, indicated in their statements that those delays would only be temporal and</p><p>that all legal payments would be made once situations get better.</p><p>Findings did not show any possible increase in illicit financial flow in the mining sector during this</p><p>period. In fact, the ban on travel prevented the presence of many illegal investors, some of whom the</p><p>community people do refer to as gem mafias. This directly affected the direct sale of precious minerals</p><p>like diamonds and Gold in the black market. However, the increased, indiscriminate cutting down of</p><p>timber for export, for which the government has demonstrated high financial interest by enforcing an</p><p>export monopoly on, could be seen as a clear case of illicit business in the extractive sector that</p><p>exacerbated during the pandemic.

The</p><p>people most affected by those policies were seen by the international financial institutions</p><p>(IFIs) as having neither the wisdom nor the right, and certainly not the leverage, to</p><p>contribute to the economic-policy debates in their own countries. Their continued</p><p>exclusion from the economic-decisionmaking process both at the national and global</p><p>levels guaranteed that economic-policy programs would not be changed to reflect their</p><p>growing needs and priorities.</p><p>It was within this context that a number of non-governmental organizations</p><p>(NGOs) engaged in the “50 Years Is Enough” campaign challenged the new Bank</p><p>president, Jim Wolfensohn, to involve his staff in an exercise with civil-society</p><p>organizations in the South in order to bring critically important knowledge, perspectives</p><p>and analysis into the formulation of Bank economic advice and policymaking.</p><p>Wolfensohn accepted the challenge and requested that a mechanism be proposed by these</p><p>and other organizations for carrying out such an initiative.</p><p>In a letter dated 9 April 1996 to the global civil-society network organized for this</p><p>purpose, he noted that, “Policy reform has had a mixed track record... Adjustment has</p><p>been a much slower, more difficult and more painful process than the Bank recognized at</p><p>the outset.” He went on to address the proposed initiative: “What I am looking for -- and</p><p>inviting your help in -- is a different way of doing business in the future. My objective is</p><p>to ensure that economic reform programs make maximum contribution to poverty</p><p>reduction, that we fully appreciate the impact of reform on disparate population groups,</p><p>that we promote measures which narrow income differentials, and that we encourage</p><p>governments to consult and debate with civil society on policy reforms.”</p><p>Thus was born the Structural Adjustment Participatory Review Initiative</p><p>(SAPRI), a joint four-year, multi- country participatory investigation into the effects of</p><p>specific structural adjustment policies on a broad range of economic and social sectors</p><p>2</p><p>and population groups. Financed by generous contributions from five European</p><p>governments, the European Union, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)</p><p>and various foundations and NGOs, SAPRI sought to add local knowledge to the</p><p>economic-policymaking process and to legitimize a voice for organized civil society in</p><p>such decisionmaking processes at both the national and global levels. The Initiative was</p><p>a tripartite arrangement involving national governments, World Bank teams and national</p><p>networks of hundreds of civil-society organizations that mobilized around the opportunity</p><p>to influence the economic course of their respective countries. These networks form the</p><p>national chapters of the three-tiered Structural Adjustment Participatory Review</p><p>International Network (SAPRIN) that was built originally around this engagement with</p><p>the Bank and that coordinated civil-society’s participation in SAPRI.</p><p>The country exercises followed guidelines negotiated by the SAPRIN global civilsociety</p><p>Steering Committee and its World Bank counterpart. These national assessments</p><p>of the impact of specific adjustment measures were structured in four stages. The first</p><p>stage called for extensive and highly inclusive and participatory outreach to, and</p><p>mobilization of, a broad cross-section of local populations affected by the country’s</p><p>adjustment program, particularly those who had been most marginalized by the</p><p>economic-decisionmaking process to date. The second step in the process involved the</p><p>convening of national public fora, organized by local civil-society steering committees in</p><p>conjunction with Bank and government officials, to discuss key adjustment measures and</p><p>issues prioritized by citizens’ organizations. The fora were designed to bring local</p><p>knowledge and analysis related to the impact of adjustment programs to the doorstep of</p><p>World Bank country and Washington officials. They were followed in each country by</p><p>participatory research into the selected issues in order to deepen this analysis. Designed</p><p>and carried out jointly by World Bank and SAPRIN teams and research consultants, this</p><p>research constituted the third and longest phase of the program.

The absence of trade policy from PRSPs', '<p>Summary
Few development issues are as hotly debated as international trade. Economic growth through 
trade has the potential to lift billions out of poverty. But rapid and insensitive liberalisation has 
often forced poor people to compete in world markets at times when they are least prepared to 
do so, undermining their livelihoods and increasing their vulnerability. Trade exerts a powerful 
force on development and poverty reduction.
Given the importance of trade, one would expect the effects of different trade policies to be 
thoroughly dissected and analysed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) – the flagship 
development framework of donors and national governments. But evidence suggests otherwise.
This briefing note draws on research commissioned by Christian Aid into the trade and poverty 
content of PRSPs.1
 This research finds that the current round of PRSPs say very little about 
trade policy. More importantly, even where PRSPs do contain a discussion on trade, trade policy 
choices are rarely underpinned by a holistic analysis of poverty in each country. PRSPs fail to 
consider the impacts of trade on different groups of poor and vulnerable people. Effects are not 
disaggregated between consumers, producers and employees, between urban and rural 
populations, or by gender. Dimensions of poverty beyond income – risk and insecurity, access to 
services, and empowerment – are almost completely ignored.
This suggests that, despite the rhetoric of PRSPs, trade policy is not determined in a 
participatory way that draws on the perspectives and aspirations of different groups of people in 
each country. In the absence of ex-ante impact studies, there is also no reason to believe that 
trade policy has been designed to maximise its contribution to poverty reduction.
Christian Aid argues that the way that trade and trade policy is currently treated in PRSPs is 
dangerous for a several reasons. Although trade-poverty linkages are complex and likely to vary 
between countries, the limited discussion of trade policy in PRSPs tends to use the simplistic 
language of wholesale and rapid liberalisation. The World Bank Sourcebook chapter on trade 
appears to provide the blueprint. Donors and governments have therefore failed to encourage a 
national debate on trade policy choices and trade-offs.
PRSPs should also, by their very nature, consider the impacts of different trade policies on 
poverty. But this has not been happening. Only one Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) 
was conducted on trade policy for the 17 countries reviewed.2
Despite this disjuncture between trade and poverty analyses, the World Bank and IMF continue 
to include ‘conditionality’ on trade policy reform in their loan agreements. Christian Aid argues 
that this practice should be discontinued for two reasons. First, trade policy reforms to which 
conditions are applied are not underpinned by a holistic understanding of poverty in each 
country. So the analytic justification for this approach is weak. Second, the use of conditions 
creates suspicion of undue influence and the misuse of lending programmes. Ultimately, it 
precludes the transfer of ‘ownership’ of the development agenda and the role of trade policy 
within it.</p><p>&nbsp;Christian Aid believes that the effects of trade are too powerful to omit trade policy from 
national development strategies. But if PRSPs themselves are to include trade policy then this 
needs to be underpinned by a comprehensive analysis of how changes in such policy will affect 
different aspects of poverty for different groups of poor people. The briefing note concludes with 
recommendations on the roles of national governments, civil society and donors. These include:
National governments being responsible for:
· analyzing in depth the impacts of various trade policy options on different 
groups of people, drawing especially on the perspectives of those representing poor 
people.
Civil society groups having a right to:
· express their views on the purpose and design of trade policy, and also contribute, 
including through locally owned PSIA, to ex-ante analyses of different trade policy 
choices.
Donors being responsible for:
· facilitating the shift in ‘ownership’ of the trade policy debate, through providing 
space for national debate and supporting locally owned analysis such as PSIA if requested 
by government and local groups
· discontinuing the practice of trade policy ‘conditionality’.
Northern governments being responsible for:
· providing aid to reduce national constraints to improved trade, such as weak 
infrastructure, inadequate access to education and ill health
· committing to cover the ‘costs of adjustment’ borne especially by poor and 
vulnerable groups through trade policy reform
· abolishing uncompetitive practices such as production subsidies and dumping, 
and removing market-access restrictions harmful to producers in poor countries.
· making good on their promises to extend Special and Differential Treatment so 
that poor countries can implement trade policies that put development needs first.
